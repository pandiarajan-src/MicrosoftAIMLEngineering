    "\n",
    "You've just set up a basic web scraper using Python. Now let's review the \"proper\" solution, which includes a more detailed explanation of the steps involved and refined code snippets. This walkthrough will help ensure that your web scraper is robust, efficient, and capable of handling common challenges that arise during web scraping.\n",

    " - Implement a robust and efficient web scraping solution using Python.\n",
    " - Handle common challenges such as missing data, dynamic content, and network errors.\n",
    " - Apply best practices for data acquisition.\n",

    " - **BeautifulSoup:** parses the HTML content and helps navigate the structure\n",
    " - **pandas:** organizes the scraped data into a DataFrame and allows for easy export to a CSV file\n",
    " - **time:** (optional) adds delays between requests to avoid overloading the website's server"
